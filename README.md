# Squid Archive setups

Squid Archive setups for various chains.

To run a Squid Archive for a specific chain, navigate to the corresponding folder and run:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

Then navigate to `localhost:4010/console` and explore the extrinsic and event queries!  

Getting the archive in sync with the chain may take considerable time. To keep track of the status, use the following query.

```gql
query {
    indexerStatus {
        head #current indexer block
        chainHeight #current chain height
        inSync
    }
}
```

## Running in production 

The provided docker compose setup is a minimal configuration suitable for dev and testing environments. For a stable production deployment, we recommend the following.

- Use a private gRPC endpoint (`WS_PROVIDER_ENDPOINT_URI` env variable)
- Use managed Postgres database with non-root access (`DB_*` env variables)
- Collect and monitor [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) metrics exposed at port 9090
- Increase `WORKERS_NUMBER` to speed up the syncing. Usually, somewhere between 5-50 workers is a sweet spot depending on the gRPC endpoint capacity.

We recommend 16GB RAM and a modern CPU to run a Squid Archive reliably. Database storage requirements depend on the size of the network. A rule of thumb is to reserve around 100 kb per block, so, e.g. for Kusama with ~10M blocks, one needs about 1Tb for Postgres storage. 

## Type definitons updates

Most chains publish type definitions as an npm package. Some archives (e.g. shiden or bifrost) have a script `gen-types.js` to generate the JSON type definitions. To update, run from the corresponding folder.

```bash
yarn upgrade 
node gen-types.js
```
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Caveats for üçè M1 Macs

A known issue #1 prevents M1 Macs from running the console.
Possible workaround:

1. [Clone subsquid/hydra repo](https://github.com/subsquid/hydra)
2. checkout v5 branch
3. build the gateway image with:

```sh
./scripts/docker-build.sh --target indexer-gateway -t subsquid/hydra-indexer-gateway:5
```

After that, you can run docker-compose as usual.
